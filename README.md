Writing Hello World in Python on Github

The openess is overwhelming here, but yet there is room for each one individually.

Poetry as a 
means of self expression and
the lack of design

Softening Cyber
Space to humanity touch
For all the Briel's

Python programming
Monty snake driven making
Money is made now

The endless growth time
Will hit natural limits
Of four elements

The crazy divine
Makes me write all kinds of rhymes
In various time

Readme files tell
Of Briel working so well
And a silent swell

The digital form
Taken over our world
Its lords and masters
